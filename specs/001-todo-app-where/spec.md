# Feature Specification: Todo App with User Assignment

**Feature Branch**: `001-todo-app-where`
**Created**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "todo app where tasks can be assigned to users"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to create todo tasks and assign them to specific users so that responsibilities are clear and work can be distributed among team members.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is in the todo app, **When** they create a new task, **Then** they can optionally assign it to an existing user
2. **Given** a task is assigned to a user, **When** viewing the task list, **Then** the assigned user is clearly displayed with the task
3. **Given** a user views their tasks, **When** filtering by assigned user, **Then** only tasks assigned to that user are shown
4. **Given** a task has an assigned user, **When** the assignment needs to change, **Then** the task can be reassigned to a different user or unassigned
5. **Given** multiple users exist in the system, **When** assigning a task, **Then** the user can select from a list of available users

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a task is assigned to a user who is later removed from the system?
- How does system handle attempting to assign a task to a non-existent user?
- What happens when trying to assign a task that is already completed?
- How does system behave when no users are available for assignment?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow creation of todo tasks with title and description
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow tasks to be assigned to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: existing users only, or can new users be created during assignment?]
- **FR-003**: System MUST display the assigned user information when viewing tasks
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow reassignment of tasks to different users
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow removal of user assignment from tasks (unassign)
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide ability to filter tasks by assigned user
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: user list/directory - how are users managed?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle task assignment when assigned user is [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: removed/deactivated - what happens to their tasks?]
- **FR-009**: Tasks MUST support standard todo operations (create, read, update, delete, mark complete)
- **FR-010**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: support multiple users - is this multi-user with authentication or single-user with assignee names?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST persist task assignments across [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: sessions/restarts - what is the expected persistence model?]
- **FR-012**: Users MUST be able to view [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: all tasks or only their assigned tasks - what visibility rules apply?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Task**: Represents a todo item with title, description, completion status, and optional user assignment
- **User**: Represents an assignee who can be assigned to tasks, with at minimum a display name or identifier
- **Assignment**: Represents the relationship between a task and its assigned user, including assignment date/time
